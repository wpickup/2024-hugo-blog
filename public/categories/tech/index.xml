      <description>I like this introduction to decision making techniques at Creative Market.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Some decisions appear to be relatively straight forward until you take a step back and look at the entire picture with a fresh perspective. You may notice that there are a variety of factors that actually impact a choice or decision that you did not notice before.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;The post also features a nice mind map example from Learning Fundamentals focused on personal actions for reducing climate change impacts.</description>

      <description>Mark Bernstein: Going To Conferences&#xA;Bernstein illustrates his argument by describing the photo below, which brought to my attention that so many these famous scientists were contemporaries.&#xA;There’s a picture in the lobby of the Hotel Metropole in Brussels of the attendees at the first Solvay conference in 1911. Madame Curie is sitting next to Henri Poincaré; they’re both examining a paper and it’s more interesting than the group photo. Behind them, a shockingly young Al Einstein is paying more attention to the photographer.</description>

      <description>After some months of not posting due in part to the limitations of Octopress, I have changed buses again. The site is now being built with Rapidweaver and uses the Rapidblog plugin to synch with a blogger account. This allow posting from the Blogger web interface and from IOS blogging apps like Blogsy.</description>

      <description>This is my first post from my iPad using Diet Coda to edit the Octopress post.&#xA;I have now converted the blog from Wordpress and built a workflow for posting from the iPad.&#xA;Not happy worth the load speed of the header so that will probably go, otherwise I really like the simple template that octopress provides.&#xA;One of the challenges looks to be efficient syncing of the locally generated site up to my web host, I am using a Transmit synch but it takes about 15 minutes even if only one page has changed.</description>

      <description>I am amazed by this, its an incredible project that uses sunlight, 3D printing components and sand to produce glass sculptures.

      <description>This post is a fascinating description of the design of Dark Sky.&#xA;I enjoyed the way the development team used a combination of open source tools, publicly available radar data and some clever numerical analysis rendered into a form that allows the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s GPU to be employed. Great read.</description>
