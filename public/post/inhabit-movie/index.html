    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Back in 2013 a couple of <a href="http://inhabitfilm.com/partners/">filmmakers</a> bravely took on the risk of making a high quality movie about the Permaculture movement in North America. Once they had shot the footage, they launched a <a href="http://permaculturenews.org/2014/05/02/inhabit-permaculture-perspective/" title="Inhabit story at Permaculture News">kickstarter project to raise funds to complete the project last year</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humanity is more than ever threatened by its own actions; we hear a lot about the need to minimize footprints and to reduce our impact. But what if our footprints were beneficial? What if we could meet human needs while increasing the health and well-being of our planet? This is the premise behind permaculture: a design process based on the replication of patterns found in nature. INHABIT explores the many environmental issues facing us today and examines solutions that are being applied using the ecological design lens of permaculture. Focused mostly on the Northeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States, Inhabit provides an intimate look at permaculture peoples and practices ranging from rural, suburban, and urban landscapes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing that strikes you about the movie are the beauty of the opening scenes, its apparent from the start that the movie will have high production values.</p>
<p>Its engaging and interesting throughout. I particularly enjoyed seeing the homesteads and gardens and hearing from people like <a href="http://www.wholesystemsdesign.com/resilient-farm-homestead-book/" title="Resilient Farm and Homestead Book">Ben Falk</a> and <a href="http://www.perennialsolutions.org/paradise-lot-two-plant-geeks-one-tenth-of-an-acre-and-the-making-of-an-edible-garden-oasis-in-the-city" title="Paradise Lot Book">Eric Tonismeier</a> whose books I have found to be valuable and inspiring resources.</p>
<p>Its well worth the $10 to see mature examples of permaculature designs in both rural and urban settings.</p>
