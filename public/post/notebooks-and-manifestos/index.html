My latest notebook is the <a href="http://notebook.makezine.com/">Makers Notebook from Make magazine</a>. Its modelled after a lab book with graph paper pages. Solidly bound and with loads and useful (and just plain weird) data in the back pages. Included in the book are two manifestos, The Makers Bill of Rights and a <a href="http://www.makezine.com/04/manifesto/">Crafters Manifesto</a>. Here is an extract</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People get satisfaction for being able to create/craft things because they can see themselves in the objects they make. This is not possible in purchased products.The things that people have made themselves have magic powers. They have hidden meanings that other people can&rsquo;t see.The things people make they usually want to keep and update. Crafting is not against consumption. It is against throwing things away.People seek recognition for the things they have made. Primarily it comes from their friends and family. This manifests as an economy of gifts.</p>

<p>One of my other favourite notebooks are Moleskins - these are fantastic and come in many great formats. Lots of magnificently illustrated moleskins can be found at <a href="http://www.moleskinerie.com/">moleskinerie</a> and at their Flikr pool (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/moleskinerie/pool/">here</a>).
