<p>I have been enjoying the album <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/lost-in-this-beautiful-world/id291476461?uo=4">Lost in this beautiful world</a> by <a href="http://www.jonlacey.co.uk/intro.html">Jon Lacey</a>. It&rsquo;s a melodic piano and guitar driven folk album with an authentic feel, partly due to the raw quality of Jon&rsquo;s voice. The songs are introspective and engaging.</p>
<p>I discovered Jon&rsquo;s music while searching for recordings by one his collaborators on this album <a href="http://www.tommcconville.co.uk/">Tom McConville</a>. We saw Tom play at the <a href="http://www.marinetheatre.com/theatre-story/">Marine Theatre</a> in Lyme Regis during our last visit to England in October 2011. It was fun night with a small enthusiastic crowd of locals and the odd traveller. His playing adds haunting depth to some of the albums best songs.</p>
