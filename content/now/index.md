<h2>What I’m doing now</h2>

(This is <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">a now page</a>, and if you have your own site, <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">you should make one</a>, too.)

### Updated Aug 7, 2024

Our Campervan has arrived and we’ve planned a few short trips to shake out any problems and learn how it all works.

Regularly reminding myself that I don’t need to keep thinking about my next “career”, instead I just need to relax into this new phase.

### Updated May 21, 2024.

Recently retired from full time work, still finding my new rhythm.

Ending up committing to the campervan and looking forward to getting out there.

We now have a 9 month old standard poodle, I’ve been keen on one ever since I read [Travels with Charlie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5306.Travels_with_Charley).

### Updated May 18th, 2023.

Getting into being 60, some things are harder, others easier.

Grateful to have a couple of long term friends.

Nearly bought a campervan but in end just couldn't match the cost to the value.

Looking forward to taking more breaks and travelling with my wife.
