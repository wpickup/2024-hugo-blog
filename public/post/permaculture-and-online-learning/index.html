Its been running a few weeks now and my partner and I are both finding it a revelation. So many concepts and themes that we had previously read about but not really understood are suddenly making sense. Geoff&rsquo;s an excellent teacher and the online format works perfectly for a couple of introverted types. We can take our time and review material as we go.</p>
<p>There were elements of classic internet marketing1 wrapped around the promotion of the course that had me a little worried, those concerns have proven groundless and I can understand that using the marketing approaches that work makes sense when your goal is to get this material out to the widest audience and in a  sustainable way.</p>
<p>As a taster, check out this video <a href="http://www.geofflawton.com/sq/26801-absolute-in-abundance">Absolute in Abundance</a>, they will want your email address however if you are at all interested in this stuff you will get a steady stream of really good links and content as a result.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend that anyone who has been interested in doing a PDC but not found the time or the right teacher consider taking one of Geoff&rsquo;s courses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, check out the many videos and resources that are freely available at the <a href="http://permaculturenews.org/">Permaculture Research Institute</a>. The links to several excellent related documentaries can also be found <a href="http://www.permaculturenews.org/permaculture-tv.htm">here</a>.
The site is an aggregator of several of my favourite authors including <a href="http://www.monbiot.com/">George Monbiot</a> who has a new book - <a href="http://permaculturenews.org/2013/05/28/a-manifesto-for-rewilding-the-world/">Feral - A manifesto for rewilding the world</a>.</p>
<p>Surfers interested in Permaculture should enjoy <a href="http://permaculturenews.org/2013/05/28/reading-the-landscape-surfing-and-permaculture/">this chat</a> with Geoff about the links between surfing and permaculture.</p>
