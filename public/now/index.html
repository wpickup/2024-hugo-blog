<p>Recently retired from full time work, still finding my new rhythm.</p>
<p>Ending up committing to the campervan and looking forward to getting out there.</p>
<p>We now have a 9 month old standard poodle, I’ve been keen on one ever since I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5306.Travels_with_Charley">Travels with Charlie</a>.</p>
<h3 id="updated-may-18th-2023">Updated May 18th, 2023.</h3>
<p>Getting into being 60, some things are harder, others easier.</p>
<p>Grateful to have a couple of long term friends.</p>
<p>Nearly bought a campervan but in end just couldn&rsquo;t match the cost to the value.</p>
<p>Looking forward to taking more breaks and travelling with my wife.</p>
