    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The <a href="http://www.krinklewood.com/">Krinklewood</a> vineyard was recently given a positive review in the local media so I thought I would give it a try. We would have gotten around to it anyway as we are very keen on organic and biodynamic wines. So last night I picked up a bottle of the <a href="http://www.krinklewood.com/">2007 Verdelho</a> which we tried with some high quality lebanese food at a local restaurant. Wow, this is a delicious wine. I haven&rsquo;t drunk much Verdelho and was not sure whether I would find it interesting. So we were pleasantly surprised to find a light crisp taste with definite citrus/passionfruit characters. To my palate it was not unlike a mild sauvignon blanc. Highly recommended and very good value at around $A21. Importantly there were no negative effects the next morning :)</p>
<p>Here a few notes on the winemaking (read more on their website) &ldquo;The fruit was picked in the cool of the night at optimum ripeness and was crushed with only the premium free-run juices being used. Fermentation took place in Stainless Steel tanks under cool conditions. The wine was bottled early to retain freshness of the primary fruit characters with very fine filtration&rdquo; Its good to see bottles boldly declaring their biodynamic origins prominently on the label.</p>
<p>Until recently many makers of organic and biodynamic wines were loathe to promote this aspect of their wine, apparently many wine buyers were of the view that this was synonymous with poor quality. Its also encouraging to see <a href="http://www.krinklewood.com/?page_id=22">biodynamic</a> wine of this quality coming from the Hunter Valley region. I&rsquo;ve written previously about the inland region of Mudgee where many of the organic/biodynamic fruit is grown successfully, partly due to the lack of moisture related problems that are difficult treat with the limited arsenal available to the organic/biodynamic grower.</p>
