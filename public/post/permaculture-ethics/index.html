<p>I have been interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture">Permaculture</a> since 1980 when I stumbled upon a copy of Permaculture 2 in our local bookshop (the same shop also introduced me to <a href="http://www.onestrawrevolution.net/One_Straw_Revolution/One-Straw_Revolution.html">The One Straw Revolution</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotopia">Ecotopia</a> around the same time).</p>
<p>Over the years I have experimented with various permaculture methods and been fortunate enough to meet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mollison">Bill Mollison</a> on a number of occasions. One of these was at the Tanelorn Music Festival held at Stroud in the Hunter Valley in 1981, not long after I had discovered the book. I clearly remember Bill wearing a skin of some sort as he ambled about the festival. I also remember the inspiring spirit of his Permaculture workshop which had a strong focus on Ethics.</p>
<p>Maddy Harland, the editor of the Permaculture Journal has written a succinct introduction to the subject of Permaculture ethics which you can read <a href="http://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/what-permaculture-part-1-ethics">here</a>. You can download a free copy of the magazine from the same page.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.permaculturenews.org">Permaculture Research Institute</a> has a dynamic web site with a large range of resources online.</p>
