<blockquote>
<p>• A large number of people in the finance business enriched themselves to the tune of billions in a manner that feels essentially like bald-faced theft. Nobody has been punished. Very few of these people even experienced much in the way of financial setbacks, because they were bailed out with other people’s money. As in, yours &amp; mine.<br>
• The general degree of inequality, whether measured in money or power, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth#In_the_United_States">seems unreasonable</a>.<br>
• The political system seems structurally unable to take any action which runs counter to the interests of the finance-industry elite.<br>
I think those perceptions are broadly correct, and I think it’s reasonable to be angry about them, and to engage in political action: This is what politics is for.
(Via <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">ongoing by Tim Bray</a>.)</p>

<p>Right on - a succinct summary of why many people are emphasising with this movement.</p>
