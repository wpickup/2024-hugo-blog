<blockquote>
<p>Was it too much to have asked of the world’s governments, which performed such miracles in developing stealth bombers .. global markets and trillion-dollar bailouts, that they might spend a tenth of the energy and resources they devoted to these projects on defending our living planet? It seems, sadly, that it was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monbiot pledges to focus on “rewilding” which I am also keen to work on.<br>
Another thinker in this area is Paul Kingsnorth who discusses in this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/apr/29/environmentalism-dark-mountain-project">article</a> why he started the <a href="http://dark-mountain.net/">Dark Mountain</a> project. Dark Mountain is in the last throws of raising money for its third anthology of writing, illustration and prose. I bought the first book and have ordered the third, its good reading and thought provoking. Check it out <a href="http://dark-mountain.net/stories/books/" title="Dark Mountain Books">here</a></p>
