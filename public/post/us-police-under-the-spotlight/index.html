<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=8775ZmNGFY8#%21">The walk of shame</a>, as UC Davis Chancellor Katehi walks to her car before rows of silent students, was extraordinary. James Fallows wrote of the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/11/pepper-spray-brutality-at-uc-davis/248764/">affectless sadism</a> of the campus police, captured forever in film. If the euro collapse does usher in the second great depression, that video is going to become an icon and <a href="http://cahouse.org/Weblog/?p=160">this behind-the-scenes account</a> will someday be treasured the way we cherish stories of riding in the car with Martin.<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-ostertag/uc-davis-protest_b_1103039.html">Bob Ostertag</a> wrote a terrific piece on the shameful militarization of campus police. He doesn’t go far enough. Chancellor Katehi claimed that the quad was cleared because of “the encampment raised serious health and safety concerns.” Ostertag argues treats this as an error, a stupid failure of understanding and planning. But it’s not just a mistake.It was a lie.

<p>Perhaps all law enforcement officers should be trained in the fundamentals of non violent action to enable them to more appropriately respond to these situations. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Disobedience_(Thoreau">Thoreau&rsquo;s essay</a>) is a good starting place (<a href="http://thoreau.eserver.org/civil1.html">full text here</a>), Ghandis&rsquo; biography is another valuable source.</p>
