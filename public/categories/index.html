      I have been interested in Permaculture since 1980 when I stumbled upon a copy of Permaculture 2 in our local bookshop (the same shop also introduced me to The One Straw Revolution and Ecotopia around the same time).
Over the years I have experimented with various permaculture methods and been fortunate enough to meet Bill Mollison on a number of occasions. One of these was at the Tanelorn Music Festival held at Stroud in the Hunter Valley in 1981, not long after I had discovered the book.

      Just finished reading the Anarchists Tool Chest by Christopher Schwartz. Its inspired me to build my own chest and stock with it quality tools made where possible by small firms and individuals who are keeping the tools needed for traditional woodworking alive. Chris has wicked sense of humour which, once I tuned into it, added a nice touch of levity to the material.
The book is about what Chris describes as the essential set of tools needed to practise traditional hand tool woodworking.

      In interviews with contemporary woodworkers James Krenov’s first book ‘A Cabinetmaker Notebook’ is often cited as the book that changed the course of that person’s life and led to them pursuing a career with wood.
The book is a meditation on Krenov’s approach to his work. It describes a sensitive and considered approach to the design and construction of several pieces with a friendly conversational tone.

      I am reading a new book by Gary Marcus a scientist who in his professional life studies languages and cognitive science. In this book he explores the research behind the popular belief that its much more difficult for adults to learn a musical instrument compared to the ease with which children can pick it up. Gary had always harboured a desire to learn the guitar and the book follows his own journey to learn the guitar in his 40’s as he seeks to debunk the assumed wisdom that says its really to late for him to become competent.

The to read pile has grown to the point where I decided I needed to create a list to keep track of them - Omnifocus to the rescue. Listing them like this should discourage me from acquiring any more until I have reduced this backlog.

Its the little part that I particularly like, these days I find I do not have the time to work through large technical books and much prefer condensed focused works like the ones published by A Book Apart. Another thing they have right is providing multiple formats so I can read this on my Kindle and the Macbook Air, the prags led the way on this and another favourite publisher.

For several years now I have been sporadically receiving a small journal called the Fourth World Review. The wonderful polemic was the work of John Papworth a great eccentric of the type only Britain seems to produce.

This collection of essays and transcribed lectures was compiled in 1973 shortly before his death. Watts was an enigmatic character who during this latter period of his life lived on a houseboat moored near San Francisco.

This is a book to pick up over the years and read a few pages, just for the enjoyment of immersing yourself in the manifest simplicity of Winchester&rsquo;s life. Divided into chapters that are essentially diary entries, you are drawn into the joy he experiences from being engaged in the world around him.

The course continues to stimulate us and our enthusiasm for the material remains strong. Even on evenings when we were tired from a busy day the prospect of some &ldquo;Geoff time&rdquo; was appealing and we had little trouble keeping up the momentum and staying more or less in line with the proposed course outline.

Its been running a few weeks now and my partner and I are both finding it a revelation. So many concepts and themes that we had previously read about but not really understood are suddenly making sense.

I like this list. In addition, its also important to consider

&ldquo;..Put simply, saving the Amazon rainforest now depends on curbing the growth in demand for soybeans by stabilizing population worldwide as soon as possible. And for the world’s more affluent people, it means eating less meat and thus slowing the growth in demand for soybeans…&rdquo;
Where was once pristine Amazon rainforest, soybean harvesters march across the landscape instead.

      The way to keep the food miles down is to eat in sync with whats in season for your region. Its a simple idea that would once have been the only option for most people. In modern first world countries it now requires an effort to know what is in season and to track down local producers. If you have a local farmers market then patronise it well so the producers keep going to the trouble of turning up.

      These days we have a reasonable range of organic food available to us locally whether through the supermarket, our local shops and/or box deliveries. However, in common with nearly all modern food, much of it travels substantial distances before it gets to us. In addition it is often out of season for our local environs. This has created a modern conundrum where shoppers seeking to buy organic must often choose a product with many air and road miles included in its true cost of availability.

      Here in Australia we have a vibrant wine industry including an increasing number of vineyards producing organic and/or biodynamic wine. We are especially keen on the wines from Mudgee in central NSW. This is a dry inland region that is ideal for organic growing due to the lack of humidity which reduces the amount of mould and fungus problems compared to locations closer to the coast, these are generally treated using chemical sprays.

Something that stands out is the advanced age of some of the artists who are still practising. Chair maker Dallas Bump is 94 and fiddle maker Violet Hensley was still making well into her 90&rsquo;s.

      In November we travelled down to Kirby&rsquo;s Flat for John Dermer&rsquo;s annual major exhibition.
Planning to be there early we stayed overnight in Beechworth and arrived at Johns pottery at 10 past nine, assuming we would be the first car in the car park. What a surprise to find about a dozen cars already parked up, even more of a shock was waiting for us when we entered the gallery to find half of the exhibits already proudly bearing their red stickers indicating they were sold.

      Just finished reading the Anarchists Tool Chest by Christopher Schwartz. Its inspired me to build my own chest and stock with it quality tools made where possible by small firms and individuals who are keeping the tools needed for traditional woodworking alive. Chris has wicked sense of humour which, once I tuned into it, added a nice touch of levity to the material.
The book is about what Chris describes as the essential set of tools needed to practise traditional hand tool woodworking.

      In interviews with contemporary woodworkers James Krenov’s first book ‘A Cabinetmaker Notebook’ is often cited as the book that changed the course of that person’s life and led to them pursuing a career with wood.
The book is a meditation on Krenov’s approach to his work. It describes a sensitive and considered approach to the design and construction of several pieces with a friendly conversational tone.

      Horrified to discover the damage that plastic bags were causing to our marine environment, Claire Morsman devised a plan for action - &lsquo;sociable guerrilla bagging&rsquo;.
The idea is that people make reusable bags from recycled material and then give them away to friends and family or sometimes during mass handouts.
Since it began in January 2007, hundreds of people working alone or in &ldquo;pods&rdquo; who work together on the bags have made over 20,000 bags.

The course continues to stimulate us and our enthusiasm for the material remains strong. Even on evenings when we were tired from a busy day the prospect of some &ldquo;Geoff time&rdquo; was appealing and we had little trouble keeping up the momentum and staying more or less in line with the proposed course outline.

Its been running a few weeks now and my partner and I are both finding it a revelation. So many concepts and themes that we had previously read about but not really understood are suddenly making sense.

Both subjects are interesting however it was the role that keeping chickens played in rescuing Mark Tully from depression that really struck a chord.
When we lived on the North Coast of NSW we kept about 20 odd chickens and 3 ducks.

      After years of exposure to Permaculture and having spent several years a decade ago implementing a disparate set of its common patterns at our previous property in Northern NSW, I am now taking a much deeper dive into it after enrolling in Geoff Lawton&rsquo;s Online Permaculture Design Course. Its been running a few weeks now and my partner and I are both finding it a revelation. So many concepts and themes that we had previously read about but not really understood are suddenly making sense.

• A large number of people in the finance business enriched themselves to the tune of billions in a manner that feels essentially like bald-faced theft. Nobody has been punished. Very few of these people even experienced much in the way of financial setbacks, because they were bailed out with other people’s money. As in, yours &amp; mine.

“Occupy” is anything but a protest movement. That’s why it has been so hard for news agencies to express or even discern the “demands” of the growing legions of Occupy participants around the nation, and even the world. Just like pretty much everyone else on the planet, occupiers may want many things to happen and other things to stop, but the occupation is not about making demands.

Its a special focus issue titled &ldquo;The money delusion: In search of true wealth&rdquo;. It kicks off with an excellent editorial from Satish Kumar which introduces the topic.
Here are a few quotes to give you a flavour of the article:
&ldquo;Let us be clear. Money is not wealth. It is a delusion to think that money is wealth.

      Mark Bernstein: Going To Conferences
Bernstein illustrates his argument by describing the photo below, which brought to my attention that so many these famous scientists were contemporaries.
There’s a picture in the lobby of the Hotel Metropole in Brussels of the attendees at the first Solvay conference in 1911. Madame Curie is sitting next to Henri Poincaré; they’re both examining a paper and it’s more interesting than the group photo. Behind them, a shockingly young Al Einstein is paying more attention to the photographer.

      The Magic of Doing One Thing at a Time:
Excellent reminder from HBR to focus on doing one thing well
Tell the truth: Do you answer email during conference calls (and sometimes even during calls with one other person)? Do you bring your laptop to meetings and then pretend you&rsquo;re taking notes while you surf the net? Do you eat lunch at your desk? Do you make calls while you&rsquo;re driving, and even send the occasional text, even though you know you shouldn&rsquo;t?

      Really good material here from Becoming Minimalist.
Finding Significance in a World of Distraction
For example, the distraction of a lucrative and powerful career has the opportunity to distract us from using our talents to benefit our immediate community. The distraction of maintaining a large and perfect home may pull us from caring for the people living in it. The urge to check up on our Facebook friends steals more of our time than the friends right in front of us.

      Great post from HBR that calls out the danger of simplifying your dreams down to a narrow outcome that can setup a black and white success or failure scenario. One tool they describe to help avoid this is the &ldquo;folder of gratitude&rdquo;
Diversify Your Dreams
So how do you start moving from one dream to many? A practical tip I&rsquo;ve seen work well is to develop a &ldquo;folder of gratitude,&rdquo; a constantly-updated list of all the things in life you&rsquo;re grateful for.

      This stimulating post from Art Markman at HBR.org has a focus on Innovation.
It turns out that if you practice finding the meanings of proverbs, you can get better at finding the same kind of essential definitions of problems you are trying to solve. Describing problems in this way will help you retrieve the knowledge you have that is most likely to lead to innovative problem solutions.
Ultimately, the key to innovation is not to &ldquo;think different,&rdquo; but rather, to think about different things.

      Rings true to my own experience How to Accomplish More by Doing Less
It&rsquo;s not just the number of hours we sit at a desk in that determines the value we generate. It&rsquo;s the energy we bring to the hours we work. Human beings are designed to pulse rhythmically between spending and renewing energy. That&rsquo;s how we operate at our best. Maintaining a steady reservoir of energy — physically, mentally, emotionally and even spiritually — requires refuelling it intermittently

      This post has been in my mind since I saw a wonderful program ABC TV. The program “Rare Chicken Rescue” has two themes, one is depression and the other is about rescuing rare chicken breeds. Both subjects are interesting however it was the role that keeping chickens played in rescuing Mark Tully from depression that really struck a chord.
When we lived on the North Coast of NSW we kept about 20 odd chickens and 3 ducks.

      This article from the BBC describes a sleeping pattern involving two sleeps of about 4 hours with a period of wakefulness in between, known as segmented sleep. It seems there is evidence that this was the normal sleep pattern until the night was pushed back by street lighting at the end of the 16th century.
During this waking period people were quite active. They often got up, went to the toilet or smoked tobacco and some even visited neighbours.

      Many of us have been aware of many of the dangers associated with processed foods and the artificial chemicals introduced by the food industry for some time. I was reminded of the horror story again recent after reading Michael Pollans excellent book In Defence of Food.
The book starts with a blistering criticism of &ldquo;nutritionism&rdquo; - his term for the ideology that underlies much of the food marketing and health food industry.

      I have been reading two books by Douglas Rushkoff. &ldquo;Program or Be Programmed&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life Inc&rdquo;. These books have well reasoned arguments that encourage a subversive approach to two pervasive elements of modern life
The rise of technocratic class that you should join before they take control of to many aspects of your life A fundamental challenge to our modern economic model and the way that plays out in our jobs and life choices This is fascinating stuff and fits into a rare category of books that change the way you view the world around you.

      This week we went to the opening night of a new movie - Son Of A Lion. This is a moving and engaging story set in the tribal region of northern Pakistan, home of the Pashtuns. The typical depiction of Pashtuns in contemporary media brands them as extremist terrorists and followers of Osama Bin Laden. This is not the case for much of the population including those in this simple story.

      I have love notebooks, especially interesting quirky ones that help me feel creative.
My latest notebook is the Makers Notebook from Make magazine. Its modelled after a lab book with graph paper pages. Solidly bound and with loads and useful (and just plain weird) data in the back pages. Included in the book are two manifestos, The Makers Bill of Rights and a Crafters Manifesto. Here is an extract
People get satisfaction for being able to create/craft things because they can see themselves in the objects they make.

      We wandered along to the Art Gallery of NSW today for our Slow Sunday. I wanted to take another look at the Harold Cazneaux exhibition. It is the most inspiring collection of photographic images. Wonderful use of light and location, especially when you consider the equipment that he was using compared to what we have available today. The images are highly atmospheric and clearly present themselves as art.
&ldquo;Cazneaux was the leading exponent in Australia of the school of &lsquo;pictorial photography.

      The latest issue of Resurgence has arrived and it looks a beauty. At quick skim reveals the usual combination of thoughtful articles and fabulous images.
In the spirit of Ghandi&rsquo;s use of spinning as an act of defiance, Resurgence have chosen baking bread as the theme of their first Slow Sunday.
In each issue of the magazine we will nominate one Sunday when we invite our members to take part in simple actions that symbolise a rejection of commercialism, a passion for the planet and a desire for change.

To do that it displaced Nicholas Shakespeares book Secrets of the Sea which I reserved at the library with great anticipation due to my attachment to stories about Tasmania. Not to mention any number of magazines and other tempting material.
