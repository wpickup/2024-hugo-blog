      There are some excellent galleries in Sydney that focus on displaying the work of local artists and providing exhibition space.
I am sure its a labour of love for most of the gallery owners as the market is not large and the work required to mount a successful exhibition is signifcant.

      Following a link from Fine Woodworking I came across an inspiring collection of videos featuring a group of traditional craftspeople who live in the US state of Arkansas.
The state has sponsored the production of a movie series featuring each craftsman talking about their work and practising in their studios.
Something that stands out is the advanced age of some of the artists who are still practising. Chair maker Dallas Bump is 94 and fiddle maker Violet Hensley was still making well into her 90&rsquo;s.

This has generally been realised in the workshop making objects with wood and more recently clay. Its harder to find in the work I do as a Solution and Enterprise architect. Aspects are definitely present, as myself or my team are generally involved with a larger to team to create and implement a new software capability.

      Made by Hand is a project creating beautiful videos that celebrate the resurgent maker scene in Brooklyn. Also see this page.
&ldquo;&hellip;Made by Hand was created out of the belief that the things we collect, consume, use, and share are part of who we are as individuals. For example, the food that we eat says something about each of us, as do the tools we use and the chairs we rest on.

What a surprise to find about a dozen cars already parked up, even more of a shock was waiting for us when we entered the gallery to find half of the exhibits already proudly bearing their red stickers indicating they were sold.

      Just finished reading the Anarchists Tool Chest by Christopher Schwartz. Its inspired me to build my own chest and stock with it quality tools made where possible by small firms and individuals who are keeping the tools needed for traditional woodworking alive. Chris has wicked sense of humour which, once I tuned into it, added a nice touch of levity to the material.
The book is about what Chris describes as the essential set of tools needed to practise traditional hand tool woodworking.

The book is a meditation on Krenov’s approach to his work. It describes a sensitive and considered approach to the design and construction of several pieces with a friendly conversational tone.

      Horrified to discover the damage that plastic bags were causing to our marine environment, Claire Morsman devised a plan for action - &lsquo;sociable guerrilla bagging&rsquo;.
The idea is that people make reusable bags from recycled material and then give them away to friends and family or sometimes during mass handouts.
Since it began in January 2007, hundreds of people working alone or in &ldquo;pods&rdquo; who work together on the bags have made over 20,000 bags.
