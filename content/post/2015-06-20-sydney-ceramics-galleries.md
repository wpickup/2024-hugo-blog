There are some excellent galleries in Sydney that focus on displaying the work of local artists and providing exhibition space.

I am sure its a labour of love for most of the gallery owners as the market is not large and the work required to mount a successful exhibition is signifcant.

- Chinaclay
- Kerrie Lowe
- Sabbia

If in the mood to travel further afield, the galley at the Sturt College in Mittagong always has an eclectic mix of work in particular furniture and ceramics.
