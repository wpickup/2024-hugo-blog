<p><strong>25 years since the Franklin River Campaign</strong><br>
In July 1983 the Australian High Court ruled the Franklin Dam could be stopped by the new Federal Labour Government against the wishes of the Tasmanian State government.<br>
Prior to this over 1000 people from all over Australia and the world had travelled down to the river site camps and been arrested in a mass act of civil disobedience.<br>
I was there with a number of friends and it was one of the defining experiences of my life.<br>
We camped in the rainforest near Strahan for a week or two and among the many wonderful experiences I remember meeting Bob Brown who so impressed me with his integrity that I have voted for him and the Greens ever since.<br>
In the action where I took part we walked down a logging track (&ldquo;the Crotty Road&rdquo;) which had been ruled Hydro Electric Commission land, meaning we were trespassing. There was some media interest as the novelist <a href="http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/mcqueenj.html">James McQueen</a> was part of our group and the TV cameras were there. This caused some consternation at my grandparents house when their nephew appeared briefly on the Channel 7 news for his 15 seconds of fame.<br>

<p>The action was well planned and we were duly arrested and bundled off to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risdon_Prison_Complex" title="Risdon Jail">Risdon jail</a>. Expecting to be held in the remand block we were surprised to find that it was full of &ldquo;greenies&rdquo; so we were put into the maximum security wing with some unsavoury characters. Those few days in a cell and an enclosed exercise area confirmed for me the wisdom of staying on the &ldquo;straight and narrow&rdquo;. Our arrest was eventually ruled illegal and we were free to go.<br>
The Wilderness Society has some videos on YouTube that will transport anyone who was there back 25 years to another world.</p>
