      This post has been in my mind since I saw a wonderful program ABC TV. The program “Rare Chicken Rescue” has two themes, one is depression and the other is about rescuing rare chicken breeds. Both subjects are interesting however it was the role that keeping chickens played in rescuing Mark Tully from depression that really struck a chord.
When we lived on the North Coast of NSW we kept about 20 odd chickens and 3 ducks.

      An article in the New York Times here tells of a couple who are shedding their possessions prior to starting a new life as organic farmers. What I found interesting was that they have had some hostile reactions on the blog they are keeping to document the journey. I suspect that many people find the idea of others who are stepping outside the norm and “letting it all go by” to be threatening.

        Organic vs local

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      These days we have a reasonable range of organic food available to us locally whether through the supermarket, our local shops and/or box deliveries. However, in common with nearly all modern food, much of it travels substantial distances before it gets to us. In addition it is often out of season for our local environs. This has created a modern conundrum where shoppers seeking to buy organic must often choose a product with many air and road miles included in its true cost of availability.

      When I considered which of my favourite books to write about for this blog, one of the first to come to mind was William Paul Winchester&rsquo;s wonderful memoir of life on his 20 acres - A Very Small Farm.
This is a book to pick up over the years and read a few pages, just for the enjoyment of immersing yourself in the manifest simplicity of Winchester&rsquo;s life. Divided into chapters that are essentially diary entries, you are drawn into the joy he experiences from being engaged in the world around him.

      The Krinklewood vineyard was recently given a positive review in the local media so I thought I would give it a try. We would have gotten around to it anyway as we are very keen on organic and biodynamic wines. So last night I picked up a bottle of the 2007 Verdelho which we tried with some high quality lebanese food at a local restaurant. Wow, this is a delicious wine.

      When Slowlane joined Slow Food recently they sent a booklet outlining their various initiatives, The Slow Food Companion. Two ventures that sounded particularly interesting were the University of Gastronic Sciences (UNISG) and the Terre Madre. The university is based in Piedmont and claims to be the first academic institution in the world dedicated to the study of gastronomy. Subjects include Botany, Food Technology, History of Agriculture, Sensory Analysis and Anthropology. The curriculum combines humanities and sciences with food technology and culture.

      The May/June issue of Resurgence has arrived and it looks very interesting.
Its a special focus issue titled &ldquo;The money delusion: In search of true wealth&rdquo;. It kicks off with an excellent editorial from Satish Kumar which introduces the topic.
Here are a few quotes to give you a flavour of the article:
&ldquo;Let us be clear. Money is not wealth. It is a delusion to think that money is wealth.
