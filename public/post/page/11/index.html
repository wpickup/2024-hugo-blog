      Many of us have been aware of many of the dangers associated with processed foods and the artificial chemicals introduced by the food industry for some time. I was reminded of the horror story again recent after reading Michael Pollans excellent book In Defence of Food.
The book starts with a blistering criticism of &ldquo;nutritionism&rdquo; - his term for the ideology that underlies much of the food marketing and health food industry.

      We wandered along to the Art Gallery of NSW today for our Slow Sunday. I wanted to take another look at the Harold Cazneaux exhibition. It is the most inspiring collection of photographic images. Wonderful use of light and location, especially when you consider the equipment that he was using compared to what we have available today. The images are highly atmospheric and clearly present themselves as art.
&ldquo;Cazneaux was the leading exponent in Australia of the school of &lsquo;pictorial photography.

      25 years since the Franklin River Campaign
In July 1983 the Australian High Court ruled the Franklin Dam could be stopped by the new Federal Labour Government against the wishes of the Tasmanian State government.
Prior to this over 1000 people from all over Australia and the world had travelled down to the river site camps and been arrested in a mass act of civil disobedience.
I was there with a number of friends and it was one of the defining experiences of my life.

      The latest issue of Resurgence has arrived and it looks a beauty. At quick skim reveals the usual combination of thoughtful articles and fabulous images.
In the spirit of Ghandi&rsquo;s use of spinning as an act of defiance, Resurgence have chosen baking bread as the theme of their first Slow Sunday.
In each issue of the magazine we will nominate one Sunday when we invite our members to take part in simple actions that symbolise a rejection of commercialism, a passion for the planet and a desire for change.

      Just returned from a concert that was the major public event of the 5thÂ World Shakuhachi Festival. This gathering was a rare opportunity to see and hear some of the worlds foremost players and was an extraordinary experience. Tonights concert featured pieces played on Shakuhachi, Koto, Shamisen and harp. A musical and accomplished Australian Aboriginal welcome ceremony was performed by Matthew Doyle. A mass playing of Temuke by the festival participants was a highlight.

      We&rsquo;re just back from a few days at Hepburn Springs in the Victorian Spa country. Its a beautiful area, quite cold at this time of year but still a rewarding place to stay and unwind.
We wanted to stay in Australia&rsquo;s only Ryokan (a traditional Japanese Inn) - Shizuka. It was extremely peaceful and served beautiful Japanese food, although the futon was starting to feel a bit hard towards the end of our stay!

      Michelle Gadd of organicwine.com.au has a good summary of recent coverage of biodynamic wine in the Australia media.
With lots of recent media interest in biodynamic wine producers the rest of the world is starting to discover the absolute quality of biodynamic wines.
She is offering some excellent mixed cases of Australian biodynamic wines including the Krinklewood Vordelho mentioned here on Slowlane recently.
Her new Catalog also has a special on a mixed box of Tamburlaine organic wine.

      While browsing the website of designer Zach Debord (found via a Make RSS post) I came across thisÂ great picture of a chook in the snow with a jumper on, she looks very cosy. Head over to their site to see more of these pictures in aÂ slideshow.
Their blog has quite a few posts about their chickens and burgeoning interest in Permaculture.
Worth a look.
For the those with a technical bent Zach&rsquo;s beam robots are stunning works that merge art and electronics.
