      In a previous post I wrote about the positive experience we were having taking part in Geoff Lawton&rsquo;s Online Permaculture course. Having completed all the online lessons and the quiz we are now working on the practical assignment which is due by the end of August.
The course continues to stimulate us and our enthusiasm for the material remains strong. Even on evenings when we were tired from a busy day the prospect of some &ldquo;Geoff time&rdquo; was appealing and we had little trouble keeping up the momentum and staying more or less in line with the proposed course outline.

      Here is another beautiful video celebrating craftsmanship.
It features Tom Ellis who started building mandolins from his rural workshop in late 1970&rsquo;s. Tom has recently relaunched his instrument line in collaboration with Pava one his co-workers.
The video was produced by the Fretboard Journal a very high quality magazine that features stories and photo&rsquo;s about guitars, players and makers.

      After years of exposure to Permaculture and having spent several years a decade ago implementing a disparate set of its common patterns at our previous property in Northern NSW, I am now taking a much deeper dive into it after enrolling in Geoff Lawton&rsquo;s Online Permaculture Design Course. Its been running a few weeks now and my partner and I are both finding it a revelation. So many concepts and themes that we had previously read about but not really understood are suddenly making sense.

      Goldmark have produced another fascinating &ldquo;day in the life&rdquo; video, this time featuring French potter Jean-Nicholas Gerard who makes beautiful slipware pots.
Although these videos are obviously produced to promote the artists ahead of upcoming exhibitions at Goldmark, they are in themselves a tremendous service to the ceramics community. The gentle pace and broad scope allow the viewer to be transported into the rhythm of these artists lives.

      I have been enjoying the album Lost in this beautiful world by Jon Lacey. It&rsquo;s a melodic piano and guitar driven folk album with an authentic feel, partly due to the raw quality of Jon&rsquo;s voice. The songs are introspective and engaging.
I discovered Jon&rsquo;s music while searching for recordings by one his collaborators on this album Tom McConville. We saw Tom play at the Marine Theatre in Lyme Regis during our last visit to England in October 2011.

      I like this introduction to decision making techniques at Creative Market.
&ldquo;Some decisions appear to be relatively straight forward until you take a step back and look at the entire picture with a fresh perspective. You may notice that there are a variety of factors that actually impact a choice or decision that you did not notice before.&rdquo;
The post also features a nice mind map example from Learning Fundamentals focused on personal actions for reducing climate change impacts.
