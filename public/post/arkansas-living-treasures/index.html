<p>Following a <a href="http://www.finewoodworking.com/item/112983/watch-a-short-film-about-box-maker-doug-stowe">link</a> from Fine Woodworking I came across an <a href="http://www.historicarkansas.org/Collections-and-Research/arkansas-living-treasure-film-project">inspiring collection of videos</a> featuring a group of traditional craftspeople who live in the US state of Arkansas.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The state has sponsored the production of a movie series featuring each craftsman talking about their work and practising in their studios.</p>
<p>Something that stands out is the advanced age of some of the artists who are still practising. Chair maker <a href="http://www.historicarkansas.org/alt-film-project/dallas-bump/">Dallas Bump</a> is 94 and fiddle maker <a href="http://www.historicarkansas.org/alt-film-project/violet-hensley/">Violet Hensley</a> was still making well into her 90&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Other artists that particularly interested me were</p>
<ul>
<li>Potters - <a href="http://www.historicarkansas.org/alt-film-project/jim-larkin/">Jim Larkin</a>, <a href="http://www.historicarkansas.org/alt-film-project/winston-taylor/">Winston Taylor</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.historicarkansas.org/alt-film-project/peter-lippincott/">Peter Lippincott</a></li>
<li>Woodworkers - <a href="http://www.historicarkansas.org/alt-film-project/doug-stowe/">Doug Stowe</a>, <a href="http://www.historicarkansas.org/alt-film-project/larry-williams/">Larry Williams</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.historicarkansas.org/alt-film-project/robyn-horn/">Robyn Horn</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The award of &ldquo;Living Treasure&rdquo; echos the Japanese tradition of designating important figures in the crafts and arts as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Living_National_Treasures_of_Japan_(crafts">Living National Treasures</a>). Several other countries have also adopted the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_National_Treasure">nomination</a> including Australia, although the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Living_Treasures">Aus list</a> is short on crafts people, favouring sports people, politicians, actors, writers and business magnates. <a href="http://www.craftaustralia.org.au">Craft Australia</a> has created its own <a href="http://www.craftaustralia.org.au/livingtreasures/about_the_series">Living Treasures list</a>, adding one person each year since 2005.</p>
<p>A recent reminder of the strong Australian links with Japanese ceramics occurred with the visit of <a href="http://euancraig.blogspot.com.au">Euan Craig</a> to give a very successful workshop at the National Arts Centre in Sydney. In the 90&rsquo;s Euan was an apprentice of the Japanese National Living Treasure <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2008/jan/17/mainsection.obituaries">Tatsuzo Shimaoka</a>.</p>
