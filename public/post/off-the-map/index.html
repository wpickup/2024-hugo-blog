<p>We watched it last night and really enjoyed it. We have been talking about it on and off all day today which is the sign of a movie that has gotten under our skin. I particularly liked the understated direction that let the landscape and the story unfold without joining all the dots for the viewer. Fascinating also to see the homesteading life depicted. I was scanning each frame for those small details that give authenticity and was not disappointed. We already had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taos,_New_Mexico">Taos</a> region on our destination list as we love native american jewellery, so now we have another motive to visit.<br>
