&ldquo;Some decisions appear to be relatively straight forward until you take a step back and look at the entire picture with a fresh perspective. You may notice that there are a variety of factors that actually impact a choice or decision that you did not notice before.&rdquo;
The post also features a nice mind map example from Learning Fundamentals focused on personal actions for reducing climate change impacts.

      The traditional teaching stories of the Sufi&rsquo;s are often intriguing. One of my favourites is known as Dividing Camels. I originally came across it in Idries Shah&rsquo;s book Thinkers of the East.
There was once a Sufi who wanted to make sure that his disciples would, after his death, find the right teacher of the Way for them.
He therefore, after the obligatory bequests laid down by law, left his disciples seventeen camels, with this order:

      The Magic of Doing One Thing at a Time:
Excellent reminder from HBR to focus on doing one thing well
Tell the truth: Do you answer email during conference calls (and sometimes even during calls with one other person)? Do you bring your laptop to meetings and then pretend you&rsquo;re taking notes while you surf the net? Do you eat lunch at your desk? Do you make calls while you&rsquo;re driving, and even send the occasional text, even though you know you shouldn&rsquo;t?

      Really good material here from Becoming Minimalist.
Finding Significance in a World of Distraction
For example, the distraction of a lucrative and powerful career has the opportunity to distract us from using our talents to benefit our immediate community. The distraction of maintaining a large and perfect home may pull us from caring for the people living in it. The urge to check up on our Facebook friends steals more of our time than the friends right in front of us.

      Great post from HBR that calls out the danger of simplifying your dreams down to a narrow outcome that can setup a black and white success or failure scenario. One tool they describe to help avoid this is the &ldquo;folder of gratitude&rdquo;
Diversify Your Dreams
So how do you start moving from one dream to many? A practical tip I&rsquo;ve seen work well is to develop a &ldquo;folder of gratitude,&rdquo; a constantly-updated list of all the things in life you&rsquo;re grateful for.

      This stimulating post from Art Markman at HBR.org has a focus on Innovation.
It turns out that if you practice finding the meanings of proverbs, you can get better at finding the same kind of essential definitions of problems you are trying to solve. Describing problems in this way will help you retrieve the knowledge you have that is most likely to lead to innovative problem solutions.
Ultimately, the key to innovation is not to &ldquo;think different,&rdquo; but rather, to think about different things.

It&rsquo;s not just the number of hours we sit at a desk in that determines the value we generate. It&rsquo;s the energy we bring to the hours we work. Human beings are designed to pulse rhythmically between spending and renewing energy. That&rsquo;s how we operate at our best. Maintaining a steady reservoir of energy — physically, mentally, emotionally and even spiritually — requires refuelling it intermittently

      This post has been in my mind since I saw a wonderful program ABC TV. The program “Rare Chicken Rescue” has two themes, one is depression and the other is about rescuing rare chicken breeds. Both subjects are interesting however it was the role that keeping chickens played in rescuing Mark Tully from depression that really struck a chord.
When we lived on the North Coast of NSW we kept about 20 odd chickens and 3 ducks.
