      After some months of not posting due in part to the limitations of Octopress, I have changed buses again. The site is now being built with Rapidweaver and uses the Rapidblog plugin to synch with a blogger account. This allow posting from the Blogger web interface and from IOS blogging apps like Blogsy.

      The following are worth considering if you are in Kyoto and interested in Ceramics.
Kawai Kanjiros&rsquo; House We have visited this beautiful old merchants house with its huge climbing kiln several times and always found it rewarding. The enormous climbing kiln and beautifully preserved house are worth spending some time exploring.
Kawai Kanjiro was a key player in Soetsu Yanangi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mingei&rdquo; movement1 in partnership Shoji Hamada, Kenichi Tomimoto and Bernard Leach.

      Stirring writing “After Rio, we know. Governments have given up on the planet” by George Monbiot in reaction to the collapse of the Rio Summit. He still finds reasons to continue to make efforts towards preserving the biosphere. Its clear however that we cannot look to governments and international agreements to do anything significant.
Was it too much to have asked of the world’s governments, which performed such miracles in developing stealth bombers .

      In interviews with contemporary woodworkers James Krenov’s first book ‘A Cabinetmaker Notebook’ is often cited as the book that changed the course of that person’s life and led to them pursuing a career with wood.
The book is a meditation on Krenov’s approach to his work. It describes a sensitive and considered approach to the design and construction of several pieces with a friendly conversational tone.

      I am reading a new book by Gary Marcus a scientist who in his professional life studies languages and cognitive science. In this book he explores the research behind the popular belief that its much more difficult for adults to learn a musical instrument compared to the ease with which children can pick it up. Gary had always harboured a desire to learn the guitar and the book follows his own journey to learn the guitar in his 40’s as he seeks to debunk the assumed wisdom that says its really to late for him to become competent.

      This is my first post from my iPad using Diet Coda to edit the Octopress post.
I have now converted the blog from Wordpress and built a workflow for posting from the iPad.
Not happy worth the load speed of the header so that will probably go, otherwise I really like the simple template that octopress provides.
One of the challenges looks to be efficient syncing of the locally generated site up to my web host, I am using a Transmit synch but it takes about 15 minutes even if only one page has changed.

      The Magic of Doing One Thing at a Time:
Excellent reminder from HBR to focus on doing one thing well
Tell the truth: Do you answer email during conference calls (and sometimes even during calls with one other person)? Do you bring your laptop to meetings and then pretend you&rsquo;re taking notes while you surf the net? Do you eat lunch at your desk? Do you make calls while you&rsquo;re driving, and even send the occasional text, even though you know you shouldn&rsquo;t?

      Really good material here from Becoming Minimalist.
Finding Significance in a World of Distraction
For example, the distraction of a lucrative and powerful career has the opportunity to distract us from using our talents to benefit our immediate community. The distraction of maintaining a large and perfect home may pull us from caring for the people living in it. The urge to check up on our Facebook friends steals more of our time than the friends right in front of us.
