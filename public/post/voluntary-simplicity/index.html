<p>As a Subaru owner and former city escapee currently back in corporate life, the cover of this book appealed to me instantly. It was brought to my attention by this review at <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/002838.php" title="Cool Tools">Cool Tools</a>. It seems an increasing number of people are setting up alternative lives and documenting their efforts in blogs and books. No complaints from me as I enjoy this genre, as long as the accounts retain an authentic feeling. Some of my favourites include Urban Dreams, Rural Realities and the Nearings classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805209700/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0375725458&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=slowlane-20">The Good Life</a>. More on these another time.</p>
