title: The ongoing challenge of how to spend your time

There has been a continuous stream of media about finding your passion and reviewing your working life against higher goals. This post from [workawesome][workawesome] is a nice summary, and once it referred to the Eightfold Path and Right Livelihood I had to link it.

[Is it a Job, Career or Your True Calling?][workawesome 2]:

> What is it that you love doing the most? What are you passionate about and what brings you alive? What work would you engage in if you had no other considerations? How could you use your talents to make a difference to society? Stepping back and deliberating on these thoughts can provide you the stimulus towards discovering your deeper purpose and true calling.

Still very much an ongoing challenge for me.
