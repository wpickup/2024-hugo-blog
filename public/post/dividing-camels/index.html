<blockquote>
<p>There was once a Sufi who wanted to make sure that his disciples would, after his death, find the right teacher of the Way for them.</p>
<p>He therefore, after the obligatory bequests laid down by law, left his disciples seventeen camels, with this order:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will divide the camels among the three of you in the following proportions: the oldest shall have half, the middle in age one-third, and the youngest shall have one-ninth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he was dead and the will was read, the disciples were at first amazed at such an inefficient disposition of their Master&rsquo;s assets. Some said, &lsquo;Let us own the camels communally,&rsquo; other sought advice and then said, &lsquo;We have been told to make the nearest possible division,&rsquo; others were told by a judge to sell the camels and divide the money; and yet others held that the will was null and void because its provisions could not be executed.</p>
<p>Then they fell to thinking that there might be some hidden wisdom in the Master&rsquo;s bequest, so they made inquiries as to who could solve insoluble problems.</p>
<p>Everyone they tried failed, until they arrived at the door of the son-in-law of the Prophet, Hazrat Ali. He said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is your solution. I will add one camel to the number. Out of the eighteen camels you will give half&ndash;nine camels&ndash;to the oldest disciple. The second shall have a third of the total, which is six camels. the last disciple may have one-ninth, which is two camels. That makes seventeen. One&ndash;my camel&ndash;is left over to be returned to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was how the disciples found the teacher for them</p>
