Human beings are designed to pulse rhythmically between spending and renewing energy. That&rsquo;s how we operate at our best.

<p>Stress isn&rsquo;t the enemy in the workplace. Indeed, stress is the only means by which we can expand capacity. Just think about weightlifting. By stressing your muscles, and then recovering, you gradually build strength. Our real enemy is the absence of intermittent renewal.</p>
