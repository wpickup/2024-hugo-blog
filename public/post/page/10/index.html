There is good in Volkswagen. We feel it -
Volkswagen is a big part of many of our lives – indeed many rebel vehicles are VWs.

      Douglass Rushkoff is always worth reading, here is a rousing speech he gave to Occupy Wallstreet
Occupy Reality - Transcript
You are not fighting against people, but against a machine.It was put in place over 500 years ago.
By a wealthy elite - trying to repress a booming peer to peer economy.
Those people are all dead, but their program lives on.
(Via Douglas Rushkoff)
As he says in the opening lines this speech covers the material that is exhaustively documented in his book Life Inc which is a fascinating read.

Maintaining Physical, Social and Mental Fitness for Peak Performance
**Mental fitness **involves the following seven practices — some of which cross over into the physical and social domains: good night&rsquo;s sleep (7-8 hours is recommended), physical activity, focus, reflection, down time, connecting time, and play time.

The Innovator’s Secret Weapon
Keep an idea journal: An idea journal is an invaluable tool to find trends and cluster ideas. Just reading through a journal can give you all sorts of inspiration. Have a hobby: Hobbies are great to spark creativity and innovation.

      Tim Bray on Occupying Wall Street:
• A large number of people in the finance business enriched themselves to the tune of billions in a manner that feels essentially like bald-faced theft. Nobody has been punished. Very few of these people even experienced much in the way of financial setbacks, because they were bailed out with other people’s money. As in, yours &amp; mine.
• The general degree of inequality, whether measured in money or power, seems unreasonable.

CNN: Occupy Wall Street is not a Protest but a Prototype
“Occupy” is anything but a protest movement. That’s why it has been so hard for news agencies to express or even discern the “demands” of the growing legions of Occupy participants around the nation, and even the world. Just like pretty much everyone else on the planet, occupiers may want many things to happen and other things to stop, but the occupation is not about making demands.

Many people don’t even know that Steve Jobs practiced Zen. His teacher was Kobun Chino, a beloved Zen teacher who also performed Steve’s wedding to Laurene. Kobun Chino died in 2002 trying to save his five year old daughter Maya when she fell off a dock in Switzerland.

      &ldquo;Because we don’t know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, an afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can’t even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four, five times more, perhaps not even that.
