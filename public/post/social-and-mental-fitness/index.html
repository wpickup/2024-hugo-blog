<p>**Mental fitness **involves the following seven practices — some of which cross over into the physical and social domains: good night&rsquo;s sleep (7-8 hours is recommended), physical activity, focus, reflection, down time, connecting time, and play time. This approach to mental fitness is similar to the <a href="http://www.humanperformanceinstitute.com/">Human Performance Institute</a>&rsquo;s Corporate Athlete program which focuses on physical, emotional, mental and spiritual (or purpose) sources of energy to build resiliency and drive peak performance.
