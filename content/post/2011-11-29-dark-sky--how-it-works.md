[This post][jackadam] is a fascinating description of the design of [Dark Sky][kickstarter].  
I enjoyed the way the development team used a combination of open source tools, publicly available radar data and some clever numerical analysis rendered into a form that allows the iPhone's GPU to be employed. Great read.
