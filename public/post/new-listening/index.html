Album by Chris Smither
I first heard Chris at the Blue Mountains Music Festival a few years ago, and I&rsquo;m excited to see he is coming back again this year. We loved his music and went back to see his show again the next day. This new album is excellent.
I have nearly all of Van&rsquo;s albums and this continues his return to form after a bit of a slump a few albums ago.">

<p>Album by <a href="http://smither.com/">Chris Smither</a></p>
<p>I first heard Chris at the <a href="http://www.bmff.org.au/performers">Blue Mountains Music Festival</a> a few years ago, and I&rsquo;m excited to see he is coming back again this year. We loved his music and went back to see his show again the next day. This <a href="http://smither.com/music/hundred-dollar-valentine-2012/">new album</a> is excellent.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have nearly all of Van&rsquo;s albums and this continues his return to form after a bit of a slump a few albums ago. Full of lyrics inspired by the Global Financial Crisis and Van&rsquo;s usual theme&rsquo;s. There is a stronger Jazz flavour than he&rsquo;s add for a while and the album features some great sax and plenty of horns.</p>
