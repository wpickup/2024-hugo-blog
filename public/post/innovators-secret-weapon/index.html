<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep an idea journal:</strong> An idea journal is an invaluable tool to find trends and cluster ideas. Just reading through a journal can give you all sorts of inspiration.</li>
<li><strong>Have a hobby:</strong> Hobbies are great to spark creativity and innovation. I once had a friend who created an entire remote control toy business because he was sick and tired of not having enough frequencies to use.</li>
<li><strong>Be well read:</strong> Reading a wide variety of topics and styles creates opportunities for cross over innovation. Great ideas will come from looking at a problem from a different perspective.</li>
<li><strong>Take long walks:</strong> Wander, stroll, skip or run. Anything to get you out of a building and thinking. Many of my best ideas come when I’m working out.</li>
<li><strong>Volunteer:</strong> Volunteering is not only tremendously rewarding but a great place for inspiration. You would be amazed at how much you can help an organization and yourself by just giving a few hours a week.</li>
<li><strong>Help others innovate:</strong> Get out there and help someone else create. This is just like the recruiting others above and it’s for the same reason – the more brains, the better the idea flow.</li>
</ul>
